This repository contains an excursion into the history and the future of **Quantum computing**.

Inspired by another [project](https://github.com/cgMuro/State-of-Art) I'm working on, the idea is to explore and implement several of the most important and interesting algorithms and techniques in Quantum Computing.

I linked all the resources used for both the theoretical understanding and the code implementations. And I will try to work with as many libraries (*Qiskit*, *Cirq*, *Strawberry Fields*, *PennyLane*, *TensorFlow Quantum*) as I can.
